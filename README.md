# ü§ñ The Intelligent Business Assistant: Workflow Automation System

This repository contains four interconnected JSON workflow files that form a complete automation system for business communication, client engagement, and meeting management.

The workflows are designed to be imported into a platform like **n8n**, **Zapier**, or similar tools to create an efficient, "set-it-and-forget-it" system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Deployment

These are generic workflow files that require your specific API keys and accounts to function.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Import the Files:**
    * In your workflow automation platform (e.g., n8n), import each `.json` file individually.
3.  **Configure Credentials:**
    * The workflows require credentials for **Google Calendar**, an **LLM/AI Service** (like OpenAI), a **WhatsApp API Provider**, and your **CRM/Contact Database**.
    * Locate the credential nodes in each workflow and link them to your authenticated accounts.
4.  **Activate:**
    * Set the status of the workflows to **Active** to begin automation.
